# Bugra's Progress Journal

Hi. I am a graduate student at Bogazici University Industrial Engineering department. This page contains my classwork in Fall 2018 semester. I am going to add my personal work as well. 
[Here](https://bu-ie-582.github.io/fall18-bugracnr/) is the original journal prepared for the IE 582 class. [Here](https://github.com/BU-IE-582/fall18-bugracnr) is the class repository.

## IE 582 - Week 0 (September 20)

[Here](files/bugra_homework_0.html) is my initial work. It contains five interesting datasets that can be used for data mining. 

## IE 582 - Week 4 (October 18)

[Here](files/HW1Markdown.html) is my first homework. I analyzed how well the bookmakers are at determining odds for English Premier League.

## IE 582 - Week 5 (October 26)

[Here](files/HW2_Markdown.html) is my second homework. In this homework, I tried to find out whether over/under results can be explained by different types of odds. To find that, PCA and MDS analysis are used. Also, PCA is used for another image compression task.

## IE 582 - Week 8 (November 17)

[Here](files/HW3_Markdown.html) is my third homework. Two classification tasks are done in the homework. Firstly, Nearest Neighbor is used for a gesture classification task. In the second task, disease prediction is done by using fused lasso penalties on ECG data.

## IE 582 - Project Report (January 7)

[Here](files/Report.html) is our project report. The project was a groupwork, and aims to make the best result predictions for English Premier League games. The goodness of result predictions are measured according to Ranked Probability Score's (RPS).

## IE 582 - Homework 5 (January 7)

[Here](files/HW5.html) is my fifth homework report. The task was to apply Multiple Instance Learning setting to Musk data. K-Means, Hieararchical Clustering and finally lasso logistic regression are used for the analysis.
